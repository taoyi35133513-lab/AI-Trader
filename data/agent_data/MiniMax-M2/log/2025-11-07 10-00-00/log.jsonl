The concentration in tech stocks (approximately 65-70% of portfolio) reflects a growth-oriented strategy. You've maintained good diversification with healthcare (AMGN), utilities (EXC), and consumer staples (PEP) for stability.\n\nGiven the current market conditions and the recent strong performance of AI stocks, a rebalancing to take some profits might be prudent, but this depends on your investment timeframe and risk tolerance.\n\n**Available Cash: $12.24** - Limited buying power for new positions.\n\nYour portfolio shows strong potential for continued growth given the AI theme dominance, but monitor for any China-related impacts on NVDA specifically.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
