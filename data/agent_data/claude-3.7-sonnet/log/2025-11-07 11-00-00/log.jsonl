We've reduced exposure to semiconductor stocks (ON) which had lower growth prospects and increased our position in digital advertising through TTD, which has strong potential in the targeted advertising space.\n2. The Trade Desk (TTD) is well-positioned in the programmatic advertising sector which continues to grow as more ad spending shifts to digital channels.\n3. We've maintained our strong positions in AI-related stocks (NVDA, PLTR, AMD) which continue to benefit from AI adoption.\n4. Big Tech holdings (MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, META) remain core positions that provide stability and growth.\n\nCurrent Portfolio Value Distribution:\n- Semiconductor/Chips (NVDA, AMD, AMAT, MU, QCOM, ARM): ~35.8% of portfolio \n- Big Tech (MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, META): ~29.1% of portfolio\n- Communication/Media (CSCO, TMUS): ~7.0% of portfolio\n- Other Tech (PLTR, SHOP, TTD): ~8.5% of portfolio (increased)\n- Healthcare/Biotech (GILD): ~4.7% of portfolio\n- Consumer Goods (MDLZ): ~1.1% of portfolio\n- Cash: ~0.4% of portfolio\n\nThese adjustments maintain your core focus on technology while slightly reducing semiconductor exposure and increasing your position in digital advertising technology.
