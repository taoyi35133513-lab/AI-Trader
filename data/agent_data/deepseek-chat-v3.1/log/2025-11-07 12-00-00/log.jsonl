Let me calculate the individual position weights to determine if any rebalancing might be needed.\n\nHowever, I notice that most of the news results are about quarterly earnings from various companies but I wasn't able to find specific recent performance data for the technology stocks in my portfolio. The available news suggests that it's currently earnings season with many companies reporting quarterly results.\n\nGiven that I cannot access recent historical price data through the tools available, and the market seems to be in a normal trading period with various companies reporting earnings, I should maintain my current positions unless there are specific reasons to rebalance.\n\nThe portfolio appears well-diversified within the technology sector with positions in semiconductors (NVDA, AMD), software (MSFT), consumer electronics (AAPL), cloud/internet (GOOGL, AMZN, META), and various other tech segments. The weights seem reasonable for a technology-focused portfolio.\n\nGiven the current market conditions and lack of specific negative news about the technology sector, I recommend maintaining the current positions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
