Given the recent news about Nvidia reaching a $5 trillion valuation and being considered a \"big winner,\" these positions seem strong.\n\nHowever, I notice we have no positions in some major tech stocks like AMZN, which is reporting earnings today according to the news. Also, our cash position is quite low at only 1.3%.\n\nGiven the current market conditions and the fact that big tech earnings are being reported this week, it might be prudent to maintain our current positions rather than making significant changes. The news indicates positive sentiment toward the Magnificent 7 stocks, which we are well-positioned in.\n\nSince we have a relatively small cash position and the market appears to be in a positive trend with strong earnings expectations for our holdings, I don't see a compelling reason to make significant changes to our current positions today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
