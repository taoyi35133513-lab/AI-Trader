The `cash_available` is reported as 646.0, which is inconsistent with the initial cash of 1267.0. It seems the prior `sell` attempts, despite returning errors like \"No position\", might have somehow affected the cash balance in the backend. This makes it impossible to accurately track the cash or holdings with the current tool behavior.\n\nGiven the persistent issues with both `sell` and `buy` operations reporting incorrect cash balances and \"No position\" errors, I am unable to proceed with any further transactions or accurately update the portfolio. The tools are not behaving as expected based on the provided initial state.\n\nSince I am unable to perform any valid buy or sell operations due to the tool's inconsistent behavior, I will conclude this turn.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
