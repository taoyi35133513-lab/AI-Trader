The buy function reported that my `cash_available` is `261.0`, which is insufficient to buy 100 shares of '600028.SH' at the current price of 5.90 (required cash is 590.0). Since I cannot make any further buys or sells due to insufficient cash or T+1 restrictions on my current holdings, I have completed all possible actions for this trading session.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
