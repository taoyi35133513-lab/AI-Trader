My current cash balance is 1875.0.\n\nIt seems there are inconsistencies in the reported holdings, and I am adapting to the actual values returned by the tools. I will finish this trading session by checking if I can make any other small purchases with the remaining cash or if any other urgent actions are needed.\n\nWith 1875.0 cash, I don't have enough to buy 100 shares of any of the previously identified positively performing stocks at their current buy prices (e.g., '600030.SH' at 28.49, '600900.SH' at 27.33, '601166.SH' at 20.71).\n\nI will check the performance of '600048.SH' which had a -1.0 return and '600036.SH' which had a -72.0 return. Given my limited cash, and that '600048.SH' has a low share price (6.52), I will not sell it as the loss is minimal, and I do not have sufficient funds to make a meaningful purchase. For '600036.SH', even though it has a negative return, I will not sell it for now as I have already made significant selling actions and the remaining cash is too low to rebalance.\n\nGiven the current low cash balance and the recent trades, I will conclude the trading session for now.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
